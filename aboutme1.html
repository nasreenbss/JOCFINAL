    <p class="p">Hi, Im Nasreen Schulze. I am a 9th grade student at Piedmont Highschool. Some of my hobbies include reading, running, drawing, writing and playing badminton. I have a younger sister and a very fat cat. I was born Sanfransisco, lived in the castro until I was about seven, then moved to Piedmont. My favorite season is spring, even though I am very allergic to pollen.  </p>	

    <p class="p"> Next year I am going to study a year abroad in Germany. I am fluent in the language and am very excited. I will be living with my great uncle in Hildesheim, surrounded by lots of my germany family and friends.   </p>
