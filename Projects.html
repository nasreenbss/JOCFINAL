    <p class="p">My favorite project this year has been the I-Search project in English Class. It was the longest project we did this entire year. My topic was "Digitilization's effect on the art world" I am very intrested in going into an artistic field when I am older, and that is one of the reasons I chose this topic. I also find art history very intresting, and it was the first thing which came to mind as I was deciding topic ideas. My favorite part of the I-search was the "Free Choice" portion. Instead of writing another essay, we were alowed to chose to do anything we wanted which related to the topic we had chosen. Since my topic was about art, naturally I decided to paint something. As a whole, the I-search was a very cool project which helped my writing and reasrch skills develop. Though the deadlines and amount of work was stressful at times, I would love to do something similar in the future.</p>
